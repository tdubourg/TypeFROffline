This file is aimed to provide easy-to-use tool for typing French text (with accents).

It works this way: CTRL + letter.

If you hit "letter" several times holding the CTRL key then it will switch between possible accents.
If you want the capital letter, just press SHIFT.

Examples:

CTRL + e = é

CTRL + e + e = è

CTRL + e + e + e = ê

Etc. ... 

CTRL + a = à

CTRL + SHIFT + o = Ô

CTRL + SHIFT + o + o = Œ



The tool is VERY simplistic. It disables all "CTRL + letter" shortcuts in your browser.


Enjoy!
