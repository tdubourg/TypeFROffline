This file is aimed to provide easy-to-use too for typing French text (with accents).

It works this way: CTRL + letter.

If you hit "letter" several times holding the CTRL key then it will switch between possible accents.

Examples:

CTRL + e = é

CTRL + e + e = è

CTRL + e + e + e = ê

Etc. ... 

CTRL + a = à


The tool is VERY simplistic. It disables all CTRL + letter shortcuts in your browser.

It does not handle capital letters... 



Enjoy!
